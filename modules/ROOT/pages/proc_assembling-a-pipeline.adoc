= Assembling a pipeline

A `Pipeline` represents a CI/CD flow and is defined by the `Tasks` to be executed.  It specifies how the `Tasks` interact with each other and their order of execution using the `inputs` , `outputs`, and the `run-After` parameters. It is designed to be generic and reusable in multiple applications and environments.

In this section you will create a Pipeline that takes the source code of the application from GitHub and then builds and deploys it on OpenShift:

=== Procedure

. Copy the contents of the following sample `Pipeline` YAML file and save it:

This `Pipeline` performs the following tasks:

* Clones the source code of the back-end application from the `api-repo` Git repository and the front-end application from the `ui-repo resource` Git repository.
* Builds the container image for the front-end using the `s2i-python-3` task that generates a Dockerfile for the application using Source-to-Image (S2I).
* Builds the container image for the back-end using the `buildah` task that uses `Buildah` to build the image.
* The application image is pushed to an image registry.
* The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the `apply-manifests` and `update-deployment` tasks.
+
`Pipelines` in Tekton are designed to be generic and re-usable across environments and stages through the applications lifecycle. They abstract away the specifics of the Git source repository and image registries to be used during `Pipeline` execution.
+
The execution order of the tasks is determined by the dependencies defined between the tasks using the  `inputs` and `outputs` parameters, and the explicit orders that are defined using `runAfter`.

. Create the `Pipeline`:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/master/01_pipeline/04_pipeline.yaml
----
+
. Verify that the `Pipeline` has been added to the application as follows:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline ls
